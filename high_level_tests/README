HOW TO RUN THE TESTS
====================

After pySecDec has been successfully installed, each test can be run by
executing 'make <dirname>'. 'make runtests' can be invoked to run all tests.
'make runselected' runs a selection of tests.
'make summarize' gives a one-line summary for each example:

make runtests:
   This command runs 'make test' for all subdirectories.

make summarize:
   By running "make summarize" the user obtains a printout of the status
   of all integrals for which 'make test' has been run earlier.
   Note that this command does not run any test.

make clean, make very-clean:
   Delete all generated files; i.e. run 'make very-clean'
   in every test directory.

make <dirname>:
   Run 'make test' in the directory <dirname>.


FUTHER OPTIONS
==============

You can set the environemnt variable CUBACORES to the number of cores to be
used for the numerical integrations. Make's "-j<jmake>" option controls how
many recipies make executes in parallel. To run up to four instances of make
and use two cores for each numerical integration run 'CUBACORES=4 make -j2'.
Note that make may start up to <jmake> integrations in parallel such that
you will have up to "<jmake> * CUBACORES" threads running in parallel.

In order to change the c++ compiler or the python executable, you can set the
environment variables CXX and PYTHON, respectively. For example, to run the
example difference with python3 and the clang++ compiler type
'CXX=clang++ PYTHON=python3 make difference'. The form executable can be set
by the environment variable FORM.

GPU support
-----------

Some tests can run the numerical integration on GPUs using CUDA.
In order to enable CUDA, set the environment variables 'CXX=nvcc'
and 'SECDEC_WITH_CUDA_FLAGS=-arch=<target CUDA arch>' (try e.g.
sm_52 if you are not sure), see the "Building the C++ Library" in
the "Getting Started" section of the documentaion for details.
